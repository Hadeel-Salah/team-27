SafePass is a simple implementation of a password security algorithm which
tests password inputs in terms of the time it takes to brute-force them. Longer
passwords equate to longer times! In addition, the inclusion of multiple special
characters, such as $, !, or # help strengthen your passwords further. We also 
offer a password generation service, generating a random password for you to
use on sites around the internet. Just make sure to remember them! This 
project was developed for the Next-Generation Coding Network (NGCN) Group
27. We wanted to display our understanding of coding in the effort to help secure
cyberspace. Data breaches occur all the time unfortunately, but having a diverse
set of passwords will help keep you and your information safe!
